The worst-case scenario for any Civil or Federal Aviation Authority is an accident in which life is lost.  The real fear with the integration of RPAS into civil airspaces is when is one of these RPAS going to bring down a passenger aircraft and kill people?  With the growing number of RPAS’s available from toy shops, hobby shops and electronics stores (Završnik, 2015), it is a pure numbers game.  The more RPAS’s start to share airspace with manned aircraft, the higher the chance there is of collisions and other threats (Exponent, 2014).  In South Africa, no-one has of yet recorded a collision between an RPAS and a manned aircraft.  However, on the 27th of April 2015, the first collision between a suspected RPAS and manned aircraft was recorded with the Federal Aviation Authority in the United States (KTVU, 2015).  This does not mean that it is the first time it has ever happened in the United States either, it may just mean this was the first  time anyone thought to  report it.   On  the 27th of August another mid-air collision between a manned aircraft and an RPAS was reported (Pope, 2015), resulting that regulations and competency needs to implemented immediately.   At this point it is still worthy of noting that the industry standard abbreviation designation for pilotless robotic aircraft has still not been decided on globally.  Thus the terms unmanned aerial system (UAS),  unmanned aerial  vehicle (UAV), RPAS, remote  piloted aircraft (RPA) and drone are referred to as the same.  For the purposes of this paper, RPAS will be the standard term, referring to unmanned aerial vehicles

it is one thing to be able to work with recorded or  reported information but, incidents and accidents need to be reported for this to happen.  There is an inherently negative connotation towards RPAS’s within the aviation industry already.  Some of ideas are unfounded and some of them are realistic.    An RPAS  is mostly a  robotic device that relies on a radio  link  of information being sent to the aircraft with an acceptable level of output of information back to the pilot.   These radio links  can be  vulnerable to interference.  Likewise, the  pilot is now removed from the aircraft itself and there is no sensation or feeling projected by the aircraft for the pilots’ intuition and instinct to take over in stressful situations.  With that said, the argument with regards to who are the safer pilots (manned or unmanned) can be argued on points of true
